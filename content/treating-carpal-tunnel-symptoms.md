Alright, so.

The question is whether the pinched nerve is the median or ulnar nerve. There's a bit of crossover, since the nerves follow each other most of the way. If the pain is primarily in your two smallest fingers, it'll be the ulnar nerve, and if it's in the thumb and two big fingers it'll be the median.

You can see here where the median and ulnar nerves are in the arm (the two big yellow lines coming out of the hand):

The same nerves come up through the shoulder area








Be aware that the cephalic vein follows the frontal edge of the deltoid muscle, as shown here, so be very careful activating the deltoid muscle. You don't want to bruise the vein.
