This page is a giant holding spot for a work-in-progress. Eventually I
hope to split it out into more pages, and even develop it into a big
reference work, more like a book.

For now though, it's just a lot of notes, and I hope you find them useful.

If you have suggestions for links or books or other resources, or if you
want to dialogue about the topic at hand, please feel free to
[file a new "issue"](https://github.com/saibotsivad/wiki.davistobias.com/issues).
It's like commenting, but with a better conversation mechanism than a
normal comment section.

## Overview

The topic of immigration comes up often, usually with a lot of negative cruft. For
example, the idea of immigrants "stealing jobs" or generally being lawless criminals
is a fairly common thought in the US and in much of the EU.

However, what *specifically* does the Bible say about immigration?

Because I want this reference work to encapsulate a very broad spectrum of thought,
I'm going to list a handful of questions. The contents of this reference work will
be, I hope, useful in thinking through the solution to these questions.

* In the most general sense, does a government have Biblical authority to
	close off a border, thereby limiting immigration?
* If the government does have that Biblical authority, what are the limits,
	and what are the consequences and logical out-working of that authority?
* If a large group of people immigrate into a country, in what ways should the
	country act and behave? Are there guidelines for this reaction?
* On an individual level, what should the Christian's response to immigration be?
* If a very large group of immigrants is, for example, fleeing from an oppressive
	government, in what ways should the government/people they are fleeing to act?
* Does the Bible allow certain laws to be applied only for immigrants? E.g. are there
	any thoughts about an "immigrant status/identity card".

The end goal is a reference work on the *entire* topic of immigration, but from a
strictly Biblical perspective.

### Evangelical Immigration Table

I was recommended to check out [this website](http://evangelicalimmigrationtable.com/).

Their stated mission is a political call-to-action, with the following:

> As evangelical Christian leaders, we call for a bipartisan solution on immigration that:
>
> * Respects the God-given dignity of every person
> * Protects the unity of the immediate family
> * Respects the rule of law
> * Guarantees secure national borders
> * Ensures fairness to taxpayers
> * Establishes a path toward legal status and/or citizenship for those who qualify and who wish to become permanent residents

They have what they call a
["40 day challenge"](http://evangelicalimmigrationtable.com/cms/assets/uploads/2013/01/I-Was-a-Stranger-Bookmark-Text-Message.pdf),
in which they list 40 scripture references and ask you to prayerfully read through
them and consider them. I've copied the verses ::link|40-day-challenge-immigration.md|here::,
for convenience. They are very good verses, and I recommend reading them in context
and praying for wisdom and discernment in understanding them.

At this time (2015-11-01) they only have a
[few articles](http://evangelicalimmigrationtable.com/resources/evangelical-perspectives-on-immigration-reform/),
which I'll list here and summarize:

###### 1: [Evangelical Churches, Pastors Engage on Immigration](http://evangelicalimmigrationtable.com/evangelical-churches-pastors-engage-on-immigration/)

> "We are experiencing a significant shift in how evangelicals understand
> immigration," said Stephan Bauman, President and CEO of World Relief.
> "Welcoming the stranger is a biblical and moral imperative, and fixing
> our current immigration system is urgent."

###### 2: [Reforming Our Understanding of Romans 13](http://evangelicalimmigrationtable.com/paul-louis-metzger-reforming-our-understanding-of-romans-13-on-immigration-reform/)

> From a surface reading of the text, it might appear that Christians are to offer
> blind obedience to the governing authorities. Such is not the case. We are to
> subject ourselves to the governing authorities as they do good, not evil, for
> God has authorized them to nurture and protect the good of all, not to do
> harm (Romans 13:4). Ultimately, Christians are to subject themselves to
> Christ in the sphere of the state.

> The church is to dedicate itself to fulfilling God’s law, which centers on
> love of neighbor, as well as the love of God (cf. Mark 12:30-31), even if
> that puts it at odds with the state from time to time.

> Christians have a responsibility in our democratic society to promote and
> live by laws that promote God’s law of love of neighbor—documented or not

###### 3: [Can the Bible Help Us?](http://evangelicalimmigrationtable.com/danny-carroll-immigration-reform-can-the-bible-help-us/)

> ...we are told that human beings are made in the image of God. ... Do our
> immigration laws honor the worth of immigrants as human beings?

> Migration is so central to the Bible that it provides a picture of the
> Christian life! 1 Peter 2:11 tells us that all Christians are sojourners,
> strangers in a strange land (also note Phil. 3:20; Heb. 13:14; Eph. 2:11-22).
> In other words, Christians are migrants on this earth.

> Perhaps Israel monitored who entered the country, like some of other nations
> did, but we have no evidence of that. Distinctions were made, however,
> between those who integrated culturally into Israelite society (ger) and
> those that did not, for whom there was a different label. The issue was
> not legal status.

> To rethink immigration law is not to eliminate borders or the rule of
> law. It is to rethink what kind of laws to support in order to better
> reflect biblical values.

###### 4: [Why Christians Should Support Immigration Reform](http://evangelicalimmigrationtable.com/peter-crabb-faith-and-economics-why-christians-should-support-immigration-reform/)

> God gives specific instructions for how we are to treat foreigners
> living among us. We are to not only love them, but provide food
> and clothing.

a bit of a summary and a "grade" of usefulness along with it.
