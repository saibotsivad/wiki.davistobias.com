title: Replacing Google Voice
date: 2015-12-28

Like most smart and tech-savvy people, I use
[Google Voice](https://www.google.com/voice) (or GV from now
on) to manage my phone number. However, I feel that Google is
treating this product as a second-class citizen in their software
line up, so continuing to rely on it makes me very uncomfortable.

Therefore, I'm writing up a page to detail the ways that I use
GV, detailing the things that make it really useful for me.

My main goal is to use this as a reference, so that when I find
services which compete with GV I can compare the two better.

You may not use GV the same way I do, but you may also find
this useful, to see some alternate ways to configure and utilize
this amazingly underrated service.

## how I use it

### GV is my primary phone number

I haven't given out or cared about the actual "phone number" of
any phone I've ever owned because I've used GV the whole way, in
one form or another.

This is really awesome, because when I brick my phone (like I did
recently) and get a new one, I don't need to let people know. They
can just keep using the same number.

### GV is my chat history backup

This is also awesome, but less exciting because Google doesn't
treat GV as a very high priority service, so some features aren't
available.

For example, GV groups messages by some `time + sender` algorithm,
so if you want to see an old message from `John Smith` you have to
search for *every* message from `John Smith` and skim through it to
see if it is related.

In other news: the searching functionality of GV is pretty poor,
at best.

*However*, despite that, I don't worry backing up my chat history,
because I know that if I brick my phone I can always install GV on
my new phone and get my chat history there. Or I can go to the web
and read there, which brings me to the next point:

## I use GV via the browser a lot

If my phone decides to take the day off, or it can't connect to the
wifi, or it decides to delete messages, or whatever other stupid
reason...

I can always get on my laptop or some other computer and get to the
web version. From there I can always view and send messages.

This backup method has saved me many heartaches.

## GV forwards texts over SMS

I have GV configured to forward messages over SMS.

Part of the reason is a throwback to when I didn't have data on
my phone: I couldn't count on the GV app to get my messages, because
I wasn't always on wifi, so I had them forwarded to the phone.

This has turned out to be super useful, even when I finally got
a data plan for my phone. SMS seems to be more reliable, so I
still have GV messages forwarded to the phone.

However, after having used WhatsApp a bit, I have decided that the
main reason I have GV forward my messages over SMS is because the
GV app is poorly designed.

Anyway, I still count the SMS forwarding as a benefit, because
when I travel and have poor coverage (and *no* data) I can still
receive text messages.

SMS technology seems to be more reliable than data.

## GV does voice to text for voicemail

I hate voicemail, so I really like that GV will transcribe
voicemail messages for me and then send the transcription
via text or other means. (I usually do email *and* SMS, so
that I'll be sure to get it if I'm having network issues.)

Even if there wasn't voice-to-text, it would still be pretty
awesome to be able to listen to voicemail over the web, or
some better interface than the old way: dial some number and
enter some pin and scream because of the annoyance.

## GV does email forwarding

I don't use this as much, but this was really useful
in the past.

One reason I still have this enabled currently is because
there isn't an official "backup my messages" supported by
Google, and there isn't even an official API that third
party apps can use.

I could imagine that email forwarding would still be useful
apart from these issues, but I probably wouldn't use it if
these were overcome.

## Replacing GV

Here is the list of things of GV that I use, that keep me from
switching to some other service:

* Some reasonable web based interface, for when the phone
	has gone bonkers or whatever.
* Forward over SMS, for when the network is on the fritz.
