title: Fix a Hacked Facebook

You've probably been linked here because you had your Facebook privacy compromised. Let's fix that.

Most of the times you'll have some "apps" that have been posting spam to your Facebook account. First, we need to remove them.

On the main screen, up in the top right, there's a little "gear" icon.

Click on it and you'll see a menu item called "Privacy settings", click that.

On the privacy page, on the left side is a menu item called "Apps", click on it

Here's the tricky part: There are apps, and you need to delete the ones you don't want to use. You'll probably have lots, I only have two, and I want to delete the "Chess.com" one, so I click on the "x"

A popup things asks if you want to remove it, click yes.

(It's safe to remove even things you might want to use later, because you can always reconnect.)

Now let's change a setting so this doesn't happen in the future. On the left side of the page is a link called "Security", click on it.

What we'll do is enable "Secure Browsing". Look at the arrows below and if yours doesn't say "enabled" like mine, click on the "Edit" button.

Click the check box and save

If you keep having problems, you could change your password. This isn't usually necessary, if your problem was spammy apps, but you could change it now if you want.

That's it!
